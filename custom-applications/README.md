# CUSTOM-APPLICATIONS

## Description
This folder is meant to hold custom applications for which support from IBM is not provided.

To start applications from this folder you need to specify the "--appDir custom-applications" flag in the run script (e.g. "yarn run server:start --local --appDir custom-applications --app <'application folder name'> --configDir <'configuration path'>").
